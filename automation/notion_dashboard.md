# 🌍 SaaS Monitoring Dashboard (for Notion)

Create a database with the following columns:

- ✅ App Name (title)
- 🧠 Spec Summary (text)
- 🔄 Build Status (select: Pending, In Progress, Complete, Failed)
- 🧪 Tests Passed (number)
- 🚀 Deployed URL (url)
- 🔗 GitHub Repo (url)
- 🕒 Last Updated (date)

Optionally use a Notion automation or integration (Zapier, Make, or Notion API) to:
- Auto-update on GitHub push
- Sync deployment logs via webhook
- Trigger builds via form submission

Use Notion filters & views to manage and track 100+ autonomous app builds.
